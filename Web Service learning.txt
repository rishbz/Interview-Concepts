Web Service

It is based on SOAP and return data in XML form.
It support only HTTP protocol.
It is not open source but can be consumed by any client that understands xml.
It can be hosted only on IIS.

By adding a service reference, we created a proxy class of the referenced service to the current project (client app). 
The proxy class wraps the calls to the web service's methods. It takes care of generating the correct SOAP message format 
and managing the transmission of the messages over the network using HTTP and 
converting the results received back to the corresponding .NET data types. 

In our example, we ourselves created SOAP request instead of creating proxy class by adding service reference.
